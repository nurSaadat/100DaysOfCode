## 100 Days Of Code

### Day 0: March 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on OS assignment. Practiced mutexes and semaphores. Participated in Hackerrank's contest.
**Thoughts:** I felt that the contest problems were easy. However the last one was very hard, I even didn't manage to solve it. I think maybe Leetcode contests are better. I'll try to participate in one as well. And my OS assignment doesn't work, ugh :<

(delete me or comment me out)
**Today's Progress:** Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday
***Today's Progress:** I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.--->
