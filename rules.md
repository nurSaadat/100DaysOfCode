# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge
## Main Commitment

### I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.
#### Start Date
25.03.2020

## Additional Rules
1. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
2. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
3. I will update the (Progress)[progress.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
4. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges or solve problems on LeetCode, Hackerrank, etc. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar
   resources will NOT count towards this challenge. (If you've just started learning to code, read [FAQ](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/FAQ.md))
