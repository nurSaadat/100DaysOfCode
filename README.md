***"Through the thorns, to the stars"***

### Day 1: July 17, 2025 
**Today's Progress:** Started tutorial for Google Calendar clone on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:**  Haven't used XAMPP since high school. It will be a nice way to brush up on the basics and learn something new.

### Day 2: July 18, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. Finished creating main layout.

**Thoughts:** Writing pure HTML feels fresh after using React for years. I am anticipating PHP part.

### Day 3: July 19, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. Added some styles.

**Thoughts:** Now I better understand variables in a CSS file. CSS properties that I haven't used before: `scroll-snap-type`, `scroll-snap-align`, `grid-template-columns`. Animations are so much easier than in React Native.

### Day 4: July 20, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. Finished adding styles.

**Thoughts:** learned new way of describing complex CSS behaviour, for example .day:hover .day-overlay which means *when I hover day, do smth to day-overlay*

### Day 5: July 21, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. Configured database table, wrote connection code in PHP.

**Thoughts:** Used PHPMyAdmin to configure tables for my project. I wonder if it is the same in production with PHP. Next I'd like to find a way to practice real life backend server configuration.

### Day 6: July 22, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. Started writing APIs in PHP. 

**Thoughts:** Last time I programmed in PHP in 2018, and I was trying to use Laravel. It feels different to write PHP after all this years of experience. I was surprised to rediscover the way you refer to the methods in PHP is using an arrow "->".

### Day 7: July 23, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. Finished writing backend. 

**Thoughts:** Surprised to see the table rows being returned for every type of request, but probably this is an oversimplification. Probably in the real world example, that would be a month by month request, or a window of three months being returned. I don't know how big the payload can be.

### Day 8: July 24, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. Started writing logic in JS.

**Thoughts:** I thought it will be boring to code in JavaScript, since I code in TypeScript every day, but I was wrong. It made me very uncomfortable to not have any types around to refer to, just matter of habit. It was an interesting way to see what a life could be without React. Imperative programming looks so rigid compared to the flow of declarative programming.

### Day 9: July 25, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. Finished writing logic.

**Thoughts:** I wish modals in React Native were as easy as those I wrote ðŸ˜­

### Day 10: July 26, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. Added alerts.

**Thoughts:** Noticed that alerts were missing from the tutorial video. 

### Day 11: July 27, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Debugging Google Calendar tutorial.

**Thoughts:** The final website wasn't showing any events, turned out to be a simple string formatting problem. Noticed and fixed a couple of other bugs.

### Day 12: July 28, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Started Node.js tutorial, as I wished while doing the PHP tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Brushing up on the basics is insane. I am so used to complex structures, that some simple things make me go wild. For example, `module.exports` statement, or using `require()` function to import not a module but a single function. Learned about CJS (CommonJS) and ESM (ECMAScript Modules) module systems and their specifications. Main difference: CJS runs synchronously, while ESM can run asynchronously.

### Day 13: July 29, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continue Node.js tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Studying the basics of importing modules, probably next time should be more specific to find a backend project tutorial.

### Day 14: July 30, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continue Node.js tutorial. `events` and `readline` modules. 

**Thoughts:** I haven't used those modules before, as I never needed them while doing frontend. Learning new things is fun!

### Day 15: July 31,2025
**Today's Progress:** Continue Node.js tutorial. `readline` module

**Thoughts:** Learned to take user's input, used methods sunch as `question()`, `prompt()`, `on()`.

### Day 16: August 1, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continue Node.js tutorial. `fs` module

**Thoughts:** Started working with the file system. `fs` methods are asynchronous, so while testing I was just commenting out the part of the code I didn't want to work. I find the error handling callback quite repetitive.

### Day 17: August 2, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continue Node.js tutorial. Continuing with `fs` module

**Thoughts:** Explored the callback way of dealing with the asynchronous nature of `fs` methods. Started working with streams, they have callbacks too, how wonderful!

### Day 17: April 10, 2020 (Friday)
**Today's Progress:** Tenth day of Leetcode 30-days challenge.

**Thoughts:** Bruteforce solution. Reviewed binary problem solutions as I will present one problem tomorrow. 

**Link to work:** [Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/explore/other/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/529/week-2/3292/)

### Day 18: April 11, 2020 (Saturday)
**Today's Progress:** Eleventh day of Leetcode 30-days challenge. Reviewed trees. Elegant binary solutions.

**Thoughts:** I would never know, how beautiful binary is if not these sessions.

**Link to work:** [Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)

### Day 19: April 12, 2020 (Sunday)
**Today's Progress:** Leetcode contest. Solved 2/4 problems.

**Thoughts:**  Ugh, hard questions. HTML problem just have eaten my time, ugh. But it is my third contest, not bad, hehe.

### Day 20: May 22, 2020 (Friday)
**Today's Progress:** Cpp course on coursera.

**Thoughts:**  Problems are taking so much time. But I like to do them anyway, so no regrets.

### Day 21: June 14, 2020 (Sunday)
**Today's Progress:** Cpp course on coursera.

**Thoughts:**  Wow. Seniors at Yandex write such a clean code. Learned about standard I/O classes and file I/O classes. Practiced reading and writing with couple of problems. I want to finish the fourth week tomorrow.
