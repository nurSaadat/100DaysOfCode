***"Through the thorns, to the stars"***

### Day 1: July 17, 2025 
**Today's Progress:** Started tutorial for Google Calendar clone on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:**  Haven't used XAMPP since high school. It will be a nice way to brush up on the basics and learn something new.

### Day 2: July 18, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. 

**Thoughts:** Writing pure HTML feels fresh after using React for years. I am anticipating PHP part.

### Day 3: July 19, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. 

**Thoughts:** Now I better understand variables in a CSS file. CSS properties that I haven't used before: scroll-snap-type, scroll-snap-align, grid-template-columns. Animations are so much easier than in React Native.

### Day 4: July 20, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. 

**Thoughts:** learned new way of describing complex CSS behaviour, for example .day:hover .day-overlay which means *when I hover day, do smth to day-overlay*

### Day 5: July 21, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. 

**Thoughts:** Used PHPMyAdmin to configure tables for my project. I wonder if it is the same in production with PHP. Next I'd like to find a way to practice real life backend server configuration.

### Day 6: July 22, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. 

**Thoughts:** Last time I programmed in PHP in 2018, and I was trying to use Laravel. It feels different to write PHP after all this years of experience. I was surprised to rediscover the way you refer to the methods in PHP is using an arrow "->".

### Day 6: March 30, 2020 (Monday)
**Today's Progress:** Solved two leetcode problems. Worked with Networkx library.

**Thoughts:** You should be very careful with the version of the library that you are using. Documentation and function implementation may be very different. Solved some Leetcode problems that include strings and dynamic programming.

### Day 7: March 31, 2020 (Tuesday)
**Today's Progress:** Finished "Iterables". Did Codecademy project. Debugged research code. 

**Thoughts:** Learned list compression and tuple opening. Useful Python commands: ```zip(list, list), list.sort(), sorted(list), list.count(item)```. Tomorrow will do Leetcode and advanced data structures in Python.

### Day 8: April 1, 2020 (Wednesday)
**Today's Progress:** First day of Leetcode 30-days challenge. Started complex data structures. Debug research code.

**Thoughts:** Easy problem on Leetcode, but I discovered for myself a new way to solve this problem by XOR operation. And it is faster than adding traverced numbers to the dictionary. Data structure reviewed - hash table. Updated research results table. No improvement for now, but I have some time to debug tomorrow.

### Day 9: April 2, 2020 (Thursday)
**Today's Progress:** Second day of Leetcode 30-days challenge. Finished data structures. Debug research code.

**Thoughts:** Easy problem on Leetcode.Tried virtual contest and failed miserably. I definetely have to practice more.

### Day 10: April 3, 2020 (Friday)
**Today's Progress:** Third day of Leetcode 30-days challenge. Debug research code. Finished research code. Learning graph theory: centrality. Codecademy: Python strings.

**Thoughts:** Decided to include centrality to the code. Exploring Networkx breadth first tree and more.

### Day 11: April 4, 2020 (Saturday)
**Today's Progress:** Fourth day of Leetcode 30-days challenge. Solved Leetcode problems.

**Thoughts:** My first Biweekly Leetcode contest and solved all problems. Solved one problem in Google Code Jam. Fourth day of Leetcode challenge - still going strong. I expect to have more rigorous questions later in the challenge. Leetcode problems were mostly motivated by NU ACM Student Chapter's Leetcode sessions. Thanks to ACM!
