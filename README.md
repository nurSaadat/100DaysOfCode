# 100DaysOfCode Challenge

Credits to https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code

Well, I like to see my progress right here. What can I reach whithin 100 days? Let's see...

### Day 0: March 24, 2020
**Today's Progress:** Solved 8 LeetCode problems. Watched MIT lecture on dynamic programming. 

**Thoughts:**  I concentrated on "Dynamic programming". I don't like this type of problems, but they are so useful. One came at my Google interview. Also solved some "Strings" topic problems. I want to do more LeetCode + start my pet projects finally.

### Day 1: March 25, 2020
**Today's Progress:** Solved 2 LeetCode problems. Read more on dynamic programming. Learned how to delete git remote link.

**Thoughts:** I really struggle with dynamic programming. But solving more problems will help me to get better at it. It was interesting to understand that most of the time the brute-force solution to dynamic programming questions is recursion. Refreshed how to calculate space and time complexity, but still struggling. I may take an algo online course, it will help me to solve problems with more confidence. 

### Day 2: March 26, 2020
**Today's Progress:** Solved 2 more LeetCode problems. Practiced Min heap problems.

**Thoughts:** Min heap is a really useful data structure. I learned how to create and use it in Python. Also I have started my Codecademy computer science path. I hope it will help me to get a better grasp on data structures and algorithms.

### Day 3: March 27, 2020
**Today's Progress:** Completed Codecademy's "Introduction to programming" and half of "Development skills". Still exploring Netwokx Pyhton library.

**Thoughts:** Refreshing basic Python syntaxis knowledge was very useful. I learned that "touch" in the shell actually creates a new file. (I thought it creates something like a temporary image.) Refreshed the knowledge of the git version control system.

<!-- but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday
***Today's Progress:** I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.--->
