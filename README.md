***"Through the thorns, to the stars"***

### Day 1: July 17, 2025 
**Today's Progress:** Started tutorial for Google Calendar clone on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:**  Haven't used XAMPP since high school. It will be a nice way to brush up on the basics and learn something new.

### Day 2: July 18, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. Finished creating main layout.

**Thoughts:** Writing pure HTML feels fresh after using React for years. I am anticipating PHP part.

### Day 3: July 19, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. Added some styles.

**Thoughts:** Now I better understand variables in a CSS file. CSS properties that I haven't used before: `scroll-snap-type`, `scroll-snap-align`, `grid-template-columns`. Animations are so much easier than in React Native.

### Day 4: July 20, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. Finished adding styles.

**Thoughts:** learned new way of describing complex CSS behaviour, for example .day:hover .day-overlay which means *when I hover day, do smth to day-overlay*

### Day 5: July 21, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. Configured database table, wrote connection code in PHP.

**Thoughts:** Used PHPMyAdmin to configure tables for my project. I wonder if it is the same in production with PHP. Next I'd like to find a way to practice real life backend server configuration.

### Day 6: July 22, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. Started writing APIs in PHP. 

**Thoughts:** Last time I programmed in PHP in 2018, and I was trying to use Laravel. It feels different to write PHP after all this years of experience. I was surprised to rediscover the way you refer to the methods in PHP is using an arrow "->".

### Day 7: July 23, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. Finished writing backend. 

**Thoughts:** Surprised to see the table rows being returned for every type of request, but probably this is an oversimplification. Probably in the real world example, that would be a month by month request, or a window of three months being returned. I don't know how big the payload can be.

### Day 8: July 24, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. Started writing logic in JS.

**Thoughts:** I thought it will be boring to code in JavaScript, since I code in TypeScript every day, but I was wrong. It made me very uncomfortable to not have any types around to refer to, just matter of habit. It was an interesting way to see what a life could be without React. Imperative programming looks so rigid compared to the flow of declarative programming.

### Day 9: July 25, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. Finished writing logic.

**Thoughts:** I wish modals in React Native were as easy as those I wrote ðŸ˜­

### Day 10: July 26, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continuing Google Calendar tutorial. Added alerts.

**Thoughts:** Noticed that alerts were missing from the tutorial video. 

### Day 11: July 27, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Debugging Google Calendar tutorial.

**Thoughts:** The final website wasn't showing any events, turned out to be a simple string formatting problem. Noticed and fixed a couple of other bugs.

### Day 12: July 28, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Started Node.js tutorial, as I wished while doing the PHP tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Brushing up on the basics is insane. I am so used to complex structures, that some simple things make me go wild. For example, `module.exports` statement, or using `require()` function to import not a module but a single function. Learned about CJS (CommonJS) and ESM (ECMAScript Modules) module systems and their specifications. Main difference: CJS runs synchronously, while ESM can run asynchronously.

### Day 13: July 29, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continue Node.js tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Studying the basics of importing modules, probably next time should be more specific to find a backend project tutorial.

### Day 14: July 30, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continue Node.js tutorial. `events` and `readline` modules. 

**Thoughts:** I haven't used those modules before, as I never needed them while doing frontend. Learning new things is fun!

### Day 15: July 31,2025
**Today's Progress:** Continue Node.js tutorial. `readline` module

**Thoughts:** Learned to take user's input, used methods sunch as `question()`, `prompt()`, `on()`.

### Day 16: August 1, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continue Node.js tutorial. `fs` module

**Thoughts:** Started working with the file system. `fs` methods are asynchronous, so while testing I was just commenting out the part of the code I didn't want to work. I find the error handling callback quite repetitive.

### Day 17: August 2, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continue Node.js tutorial. Continuing with `fs` module

**Thoughts:** Explored the callback way of dealing with the asynchronous nature of `fs` methods. Started working with streams, they have callbacks too, how wonderful!

### Day 18: August 3, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Continue Node.js tutorial. Creating my server.

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot of things today. I am starting from basics, and NoobCoder is very good at explaining them. I worked with `path`, `express` modules. Learned what Express is (it is a framework, an abstraction on top of Node.js, helps writing server code faster). Was exciting to parce some data from the forms and do some silly stuff. I will try to find more tutorials that involve communication with the database though.

### Day 19: August 4, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Finished Node.js tutorial!

**Thoughts:** Really wanted to finish with this tutorial, it is quite old and not everything works as in tutorial (some modules has changed their interfaces). I even posted a comment to the video with the updated snippet. It was nice to write a simple middleware, I immediately remembered axios middlewares. Also it was nice to practice using different modules for backend tasks.

### Day 20, August 5, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Downloaded Postgres, tested connecting to Postgres database.

**Thoughts:** Finally started working with something more up to date. The tutorial describes version 16, while version 17 is released already. Maybe I can submit some updates to the documentation.

**Link to work:** [Neon Postgres tutorial](https://neon.com/postgresql/postgresql-getting-started/connect-to-postgresql-database)

### Day 21: August 6, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Learned `SELECT` statement.

**Thoughts:** Fisrt time seeing the possibility to add column alias and concatenation operator `||` to concatenate results from two different columns.

**Link to work** [Neon tutorial: Postgres SELECT](https://neon.com/postgresql/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-select)

### Day 22: August 7, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Learned `ORDER BY` statement.

**Thoughts:**  Was interesting to learn about options `NULLS FIRST` and `NULLS LAST`.

### Day 23: August 8, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Learned `SELECT DISTINCT` statement.

**Thoughts:** Reminded myself how to switch databases using `\c database_name` command. Learned how to amend commit author.

### Day 24: August 9, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Learned `WHERE` statement.

**Thoughts:** Refreshed SQL statements to make smarter selections. Learned that `%` is a wild card for an SQL query.

### Day 25: August 10, 2025
**Today's Progress:** I remadee my profile header with some new animated features.

**Thoughts:** Based on statistics, I am C# coder, which is not qiute right. Need to contribute and write more typescript stuff and host it on my domain.

### Day 26: August 11, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Studied `OR` and `AND` operators.

**Thoughts:** SQL has a third logical value which is `null`. It makes logical tables more complex.

### Day 27: August 12, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Studied `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`, and `FETCH` clauses.

**Thoughts:** `FETCH` is an SQL standard, while `LIMIT` is not. Although `LIMIT` is supported, it is not recommended to use it to make a query compatible with other database management systems.

### Day 28: August 13, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Studied `SELECT IN` and `BETWEEN` operators.

**Thoughts:** Learned cast operator `::`.

### Day 28: August 14, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Studied `LIKE` and `ILIKE` operators.

**Thoughts:** Learned also `ESCAPE` operator, and that there is another way to write `LIKE` operator with ~~. Found another wildcard character `_` that matches any single character. For example `_bc` would match `abc`, but not `aabc`.

### Day 28: August 15, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Studied `IS NULL` operator.

**Thoughts:** Null is indeed a  very tricky value. Also it is not equal to empty string, while looking the same is you don't explicitly run command to make it 'NULL'.
