# 100DaysOfCode Challenge

Credits to https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code

Well, I like to see my progress right here. What can I reach whithin 100 days? Let's see...

### Day 0: March 24, 2020 (Tuesday)
**Today's Progress:** Solved 8 LeetCode problems. Watched MIT lecture on dynamic programming. 

**Thoughts:**  I concentrated on "Dynamic programming". I don't like this type of problems, but they are so useful. One came at my Google interview. Also solved some "Strings" topic problems. I want to do more LeetCode + start my pet projects finally.

### Day 1: March 25, 2020 (Wednesday)
**Today's Progress:** Solved 2 LeetCode problems. Read more on dynamic programming. Learned how to delete git remote link.

**Thoughts:** I really struggle with dynamic programming. But solving more problems will help me to get better at it. It was interesting to understand that most of the time the brute-force solution to dynamic programming questions is recursion. Refreshed how to calculate space and time complexity, but still struggling. I may take an algo online course, it will help me to solve problems with more confidence. 

### Day 2: March 26, 2020 (Thursday)
**Today's Progress:** Solved 2 more LeetCode problems. Practiced Min heap problems.

**Thoughts:** Min heap is a really useful data structure. I learned how to create and use it in Python. Also I have started my Codecademy computer science path. I hope it will help me to get a better grasp on data structures and algorithms.

### Day 3: March 27, 2020 (Friday)
**Today's Progress:** Completed Codecademy's "Introduction to programming" and half of "Development skills". Still exploring Netwokx Pyhton library.

**Thoughts:** Refreshing basic Python syntaxis knowledge was very useful. I learned that "touch" in the shell actually creates a new file. (I thought it creates something like a temporary image.) Refreshed the knowledge of the git version control system.

### Day 4: March 28, 2020 (Saturday)
**Today's Progress:** Completed Codecademy's "Development skills". Started "Flow Control". Solved Leetcode problems.

**Thoughts:** It is very interesting to learn new things about the language that you use frequently. Today's Leetcode session showed me simpler solutions to "String" problems using indexes instead of strings themselves.

### Day 5: March 29, 2020 (Sunday)
**Today's Progress:** Finished "Flow control". Paticipated in Leetcode contest.

**Thoughts:** My first Leetcode contest and I managed to solve three problems out of four. Next time I want to solve all four. I want to finish Python recap quickly so I can do data structures soon.

### Day 6: March 30, 2020 (Monday)
**Today's Progress:** Solved two leetcode problems. Worked with Networkx library.

**Thoughts:** You should be very careful with the version of the library that you are using. Documentation and function implementation may be very different. Solved some Leetcode problems that include strings and dynamic programming.

### Day 7: March 31, 2020 (Tuesday)
**Today's Progress:** Finished "Iterables". Did Codecademy project. Debugged research code. 

**Thoughts:** Learned list compression and tuple opening. Useful Python commands: ```zip(list, list), list.sort(), sorted(list), list.count(item)```. Tomorrow will do Leetcode and advanced data structures in Python.

### Day 8: April 1, 2020 (Wednesday)
**Today's Progress:** First day of Leetcode 30-days challenge. Started complex data structures. Debug research code.

**Thoughts:** Easy problem on Leetcode, but I discovered for myself a new way to solve this problem by XOR operation. And it is faster than adding traverced numbers to the dictionary. Data structure reviewed - hash table. Updated research results table. No improvement for now, but I have some time to debug tomorrow.

### Day 9: April 2, 2020 (Thursday)
**Today's Progress:** Second day of Leetcode 30-days challenge. Finished data structures. Debug research code.

**Thoughts:** Easy problem on Leetcode.Tried virtual contest and failed miserably. I definetely have to practice more.

### Day 10: April 3, 2020 (Friday)
**Today's Progress:** Third day of Leetcode 30-days challenge. Debug research code. Finished research code. Learning graph theory: centrality. Codecademy: Python strings.

**Thoughts:** Decided to include centrality to the code. Exploring Networkx breadth first tree and more. 

**Link to work:** [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

### Day 11: April 4, 2020 (Saturday)
**Today's Progress:** Fourth day of Leetcode 30-days challenge. Solved Leetcode problems.

**Thoughts:** My first Biweekly Leetcode contest and solved all problems. Solved one problem in Google Code Jam. Fourth day of Leetcode challenge - still going strong. I expect to have more rigorous questions later in the challenge. Leetcode problems were mostly motivated by NU ACM Student Chapter's Leetcode sessions. Thanks to ACM!

### Day 12: April 5, 2020 (Sunday)
**Today's Progress:** Fifth day of Leetcode 30-days challenge.

**Thoughts:** Solved Leetcode problems.
