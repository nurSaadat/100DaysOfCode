# 100DaysOfCode Challenge

Credits to https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code

Well, I like to see my progress right here. What can I reach whithin 100 days? Let's see...

### Day 0: March 24, 2020
**Today's Progress:** Solved 8 LeetCode problems. Watched MIT lecture on dynamic programming. 
**Thoughts:**  I concentrated on "Dynamic programming". I don't like this type of problems, but they are so useful. One came at my Google interview. Also solved some "Strings" topic problems. I want to do more LeetCode + start my pet projects finally.
**Link to work:** None 

<!---### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
(delete me or comment me out)
**Today's Progress:** Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
**Link(s) to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com/)
### Day 1: June 27, Monday
***Today's Progress:** I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.--->
